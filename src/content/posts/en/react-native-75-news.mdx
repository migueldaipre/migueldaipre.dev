### Hello, React Native developers!

React Native 0.75 is here, bringing a wave of exciting improvements and enhancements that will elevate your mobile development experience. 
Let's dive into the key highlights of this release:

</div>

#### 1. React 19: Faster, More Efficient, and Future-Ready
<div style={{padding: '1rem 0.4rem'}}>
While React 19 doesn't introduce groundbreaking new features specifically for React Native 0.75, it ensures you're leveraging the best in terms of performance, stability, and future-proofing. This means:

- More Responsive Apps: Enjoy smooth, lag-free interfaces even on devices with limited resources.
- Enhanced Memory Management: Optimized memory usage for overall better performance.
- Solid Architecture for the Future: Stay prepared for upcoming React innovations with React 19 already integrated, paving the way for React Compiler usage in the future.

</div>

#### 2. Migrating Community CLI Commands to React Native Core [(RFC-0759)](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0759-react-native-frameworks.md#rfc0759-react-native-frameworks)

<div style={{ padding: '1rem 0.4rem'}}>
The following commands have been moved from the community CLI to React Native Core. This change aims to simplify CLI maintenance and provide a more cohesive development experience.
```shell
react-native clean
react-native build-android --mode=release
react-native build-ios --mode=release
```
When using the `react-native init` command, a deprecation warning will be displayed. To continue using the functionality of the init command after September 29, 2024, use the community CLI:
<Image src={RN75InitWarning} alt="react native 0.75 init deprecation warning" />

```shell
npx @react-native-community/cli init
```

</div>

#### 3. Community Template [(RFC-0759)](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0759-react-native-frameworks.md#evolving-the-react-native-community-template--cli)

<div style={{ padding: '1rem 0.4rem'}}>
  The default template for a new project created with

  ```sh
  npx @react-native-community/cli init
  ```

  is now available separately from React Native Core [(react-native-community/template)](https://github.com/react-native-community/template).

  **This repository contains the template used by the Community (CLI) to start a new React Native project.**
</div>


#### 4. Yoga: % Support in the gap property

<div style={{ padding: '1rem 0.4rem'}}>
Create even more flexible and responsive layouts with Yoga's support for percentages (%) in the gap property. This feature facilitates dynamic spacing between elements, adapting perfectly to different screen sizes.
```tsx
  export function MyScreen() {
    return (
      <View style={stylesheet.container}>
        <View>
          <Text> Box 1 </Text>
        </View>
        <View>
          <Text> Box 2 </Text>
        </View>
      </View>
    )
  }

  const stylesheet = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      flex: 1,
      gap: '10%'
    },
  })
```
</div>
